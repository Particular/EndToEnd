### Current action items

 - [x] Migrate performance test code
 - [ ] Identify what is the generated code is currently testing? @dvdstelt 
   - [ ] What are the shortcomings?
   - [ ] Is the seeding of data in-process going to affect the validity of the results?
   - [ ] Is the capturing of metrics in-process going to affect the validity of the results?
 - [ ] Create NUnit fixtures for each category in [the google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1avUW8Y5gpcPqTxIBaq7X5OXXaE4lDU0e0ZA9FDFNygs/edit#gid=771631393) where the fixture generates all permutations for all variable values in that category @ramonsmits 
    - [ ] How would these isolated tests look?
    - [ ] How are we going to generate tests for each isolated operation?
 - [ ] Include Metrics.Net to track [required metrics](https://github.com/Particular/EndToEnd/blob/docs/docs/metrics.md) @williambza
 - [ ] Include basic [test configurations](https://github.com/Particular/EndToEnd/blob/docs/docs/variables.md) @hmemcpy
 - [ ] Setup environments: @gbiellem 
   - Queues
    - [ ] SQL2012 (Queues), 
    - [ ] Rabbit, 
   - Persistence
     - [ ] SQL2012 (Persistence),
     - [ ] RavenDB v3, 
   - Runners:
     - [ ] Master (MSMQ)
     - [ ] Worker 3x (MSMQ)
  - Infrastructure
     - [ ] DTC
 
 ### Future actions
 
- [ ] Collate metric results into usable format upon test completion
- [ ] Collect initial results and provide feedback for V6 Launch TF.
- [ ] Allow customization of maximum run-time (so we don't ever have unbounded runs)
- [ ] Implement test source for test permutations of persistence and transport providers @hmemcpy 
- [ ] Can TC setup multiple VM's for a task?
 - Database VM
 - Transport VM
 - Runner VM
 
 ### Completed actions

- [x] Decide on test variables
- [x] Decide on metrics to capture
- [x] Can we capture all metrics when running in an AppDomain? @hmemcpy
 - [x] Are RAM and CPU performance counters available in AppDomains?
  - We need to use a process as not all useful resource utiliization performance counters are available in the scope of an app domain.
 - [x] Is time to first message (TTFM) equal?
  - It seems TTFM for app domains is faster but we don't have a large collection of runs for comparison.
- [x] Test permutations will be generated by NUnit, but the actual stress tests will be run as processes in the final environment
- [x] Should the benchmark run different tests for each variable in isolation?
    - V1 - No
    - vNext - Yes (but also include a combined benchmark)
- [x] Define categories / test permutations
